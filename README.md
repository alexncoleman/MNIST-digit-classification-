MNIST digit Classification neural network 

Most code is from  Michael A. Nielsen, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", Determination Press, 2015

I changed to original code to make the backpropagation use a matrix containing all of the input vectors in the mini batch in order to speed up learning.
The orginal code is 'Network 1, 3 layers.py'
The code with matrix based backpropagation is 'Network 1, Matrices backprop.py'
